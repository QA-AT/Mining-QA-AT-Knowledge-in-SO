This repository includes the data and resulst fo the Paper "Mining Architecture Tactics and Quality Attributes Knowledge in Stack Pverflow"

- 1. Traning Data for classifier training.xsl

comprises the 1165 QA-AT posts (with link) and 1200 non QA-AT psosts that collected from Stack Overflow for classifier training.

- 2. AT related terms.pdf
comprises AT names and their related terms. AT names are used for searching QA-AT posts, and AT related terms are used for dictionary training.

- 3. QA related terms
comprises QAs and their related terms. QAs are used for eight high-level QAs identification, and QA related terms are used for dictionary training.

- 4. The output of the trained dictionary.xsl
comprises the sensitive terms of QAs and ATs in the dictionary trained by the 4,000 architectural posts.

- 5. QA-AT posts labelling and encoding.mx20
is the results of QA-AT posts labelling and encoding that were analyzed by the MAXQDA tool. 
We analyzed and coded the considerations discussed in QA-AT posts and the relationships between QAs and ATs. 
Particularly, the relationships between ATs and QAs can be found in the group named "ATs->QAs" in the coding results. 
The file can be opened by MAXQDA 2020 or higher versions, which are available at https://www.maxqdacom/ for download.
